# PortfolioProject

I'm going to list some of the steps I did for this Project.
I'll leave the link for the Visualization here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ronaldo.felix.junior/viz/CovidDashboard_16917223550060/Dashboard1?publish=yes

First, I came accross this Dataset on Youtube and downloaded it from GitHub.

I'm using a mac so in order for me to use the SQL server, I'm running docker + Azure Data Studio. 

The File came into two excels, one for Covid Deaths and one for Vaccinations, I had to move around some collumns to make it easier to see when running the queries.

I had a lot of trouble to import these datasets into SQL because of the format (int, varchar and so on), manually changed all of them individually in the "Import Wizard" 

After that was just a matter of coming up with the right ideas and queries to get some pretty interestings insights.

Then I went to Tableau to visualize everything in a better way. 

I used the same queries I created in SQL to export into excel and then import into Tableau.
